# Hexic API
A quick way to make cross-platform TCP server for use in games and other things
## Hexic API is great because:
- It has end-to-end encryption
- It supports threads and ip banning
- It has user and guest management
-- Support for user data encryption
-- Custom IDs
-- Admin management

# Usage

## Websocket testing and usage!
- Make a hexicapi server in the normal manner, remember your ip:port (most probably use localhost here for the ip)
- Make a cloudflare tunnel (you can use cloudflared to make a temporary tunnel or install a service and make a permanent tunnel with cloudflare)
- Connect using the provided websocket

Provided you don't have any security on the cloudflare tunnel you should easily be able to connect through and receive things just as normal, works both with python and javascript
